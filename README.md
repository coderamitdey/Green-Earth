1) Difference between var, let, and const

Scope:

var → function-scoped

let & const → block-scoped

Redeclaration:

var → allowed

let & const → not allowed

Reassignment:

var & let → allowed

const → not allowed (for primitive values)

Hoisting:

var → hoisted and initialized with undefined

let & const → hoisted but not initialized 


2) Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()

forEach(): iterates over array, performs side effects, returns undefined.

map(): transforms each element, returns a new array.

filter(): returns a new array with elements that satisfy a condition.


3) Arrow functions in ES6

A shorter syntax for writing functions.

No this binding of its own.


4) Destructuring assignment in ES6

Allows you to unpack arrays or objects into variables.

Makes code concise and readable.


5) Template literals in ES6

Use backticks (`) instead of quotes.

Allows interpolation with ${expression}.

Supports multi-line strings easily.
